###Entities

`Entities represent the data provided by our data provider.`

The entities.dart file is a barrel file that exports the todo_entity.dart file.

`export 'todo_entity.dart';`

Our TodoEntity is the representation of our Todo inside Firestore. Create todo_entity.dart and let's implement it.
